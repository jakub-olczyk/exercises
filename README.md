# Exercises
This is repo containing some of my programming excercises.
I hope someone could find something useful here. 
I do know that the quality of some listings is poor, 
but I leave it here just as a remainder for myself.

Currently there are:

* microcontrollers = AVR programming
* qt-ezust = GUI and Database connection exercises.
